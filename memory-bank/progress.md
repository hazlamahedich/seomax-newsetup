Successfully completed Phase 1-8 implementation, including all core features required for keyword research and analysis. The application now has a fully functional project management system, keyword research interface with AI-powered analysis, and a domain overview dashboard. We have also rebuilt and improved the authentication system and dashboard layout in Phase 9, and implemented a complete projects page with CRUD functionality in Phase 10. Phase 11 is now largely complete with the implementation of the LLM management system. Phase 12 for SEO Audit and Reporting features is also well underway with the implementation of PDF export functionality.

The SEO Audit features currently implemented include:
- Basic audit report generation with categories and scores
- Technical issues identification with severity levels
- PDF export with professional formatting
- Overall score calculation and grade assignment
- Category-specific scores and recommendations
- Reusable UI components for triggering PDF generation

We are now planning to enhance the SEO Audit system with more advanced features including customization options for PDF reports, white-labeling capabilities, additional technical checks, content analysis, backlink analysis, social media integration, local SEO assessment, and competitive analysis.

Key implementations include:
- Keyword research interface with AI analysis capabilities (using LangChain and OpenAI)
- Project dashboard with key SEO metrics (SEO score, rankings, visitors)
- Content analyzer with readability and keyword usage analysis
- Project navigation with tab-based interface
- User authentication with NextAuth and Supabase
- Database schema for projects, keywords, and content
- Responsive dashboard layout with mobile-friendly design
- Robust authentication system with proper error handling
- Projects page with grid layout and full CRUD operations
- React Query integration for data fetching with proper state management
- Zustand store for client-side state management
- LLM management system with model configuration, testing, and usage tracking
- Visualization of AI usage statistics and costs
- SEO Audit system with comprehensive reporting
- PDF export feature for SEO audit reports with professional formatting

The codebase is structured with clear separation of concerns, with dedicated services for AI analysis, data operations, and UI components. The next focus is on enhancing the dashboard with more interactive visualizations and customization options, and improving the projects management with additional features like filtering, sorting, and categorization. We will also expand the LLM management system with support for additional providers and more advanced features. For the SEO Audit system, we plan to add customization options for PDF reports and implement white-labeling capabilities.

## Known Issues
