## Current Status
Successfully completed Phase 1 implementation, including all core features required for keyword research and analysis. The application now has a fully functional project management system, keyword research interface with AI-powered analysis, and a domain overview dashboard.

Key implementations include:
- Keyword research interface with AI analysis capabilities (using LangChain and OpenAI)
- Project dashboard with key SEO metrics (SEO score, rankings, visitors)
- Content analyzer with readability and keyword usage analysis
- Project navigation with tab-based interface
- User authentication with Supabase
- Database schema for projects, keywords, and content

The codebase is structured with clear separation of concerns, with dedicated services for AI analysis, data operations, and UI components. The next phase will focus on developing the technical SEO analysis features.

## Known Issues
- Need to implement error handling for AI service calls (especially when API keys are missing)
- Some LangChain imports need to be updated to match the available package versions
- Content analyzer could benefit from more comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Project dashboard metrics currently use placeholder data in some areas
- Need to implement real-time data fetching for keyword positions
