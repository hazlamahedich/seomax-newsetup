# Product Context: SEOMax

## Why This Project Exists
SEOMax addresses the need for professional SEO tools that are accessible to small businesses, content creators, and marketers with limited budgets. Most comprehensive SEO platforms are expensive, while free tools often lack depth and integration. SEOMax bridges this gap by providing a robust set of AI-powered SEO tools within the constraints of free-tier cloud services.

- **Technical Complexity**: Simplifies SEO concepts with AI-powered recommendations and explanations
- **Resource Limitations**: Optimizes processing and storage to operate within free tier constraints
- **Scattered Tools**: Integrates keyword research, technical analysis, content optimization, and backlink analysis in one platform
- **Data Silos**: Connects different aspects of SEO for holistic website optimization
