   - Add tooltips and guided tours for complex functionality

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for LLM responses where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries for large datasets

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- All AI services use the centralized LLM service for consistency
- New services follow the established static method pattern
- UI components maintain consistency with existing design system
- Database tables include proper RLS policies for security

1. **Dual-Source Keyword Trend Analysis**: We've implemented a flexible approach that first attempts to use an external API (if configured) and automatically falls back to LLM-based analysis when the API is unavailable. This provides the best of both worlds: accurate data from specialized APIs when available, with consistent functionality through LLM fallback when external services aren't accessible.

2. **Mock Data Enhancement for LLM Context**: When using LLM for trend analysis, we generate realistic mock historical data to provide better context. This approach improves the quality of LLM predictions by giving it structured historical patterns to analyze, rather than asking it to generate trends from scratch.

3. **Shared Response Structure**: Regardless of the data source (external API or LLM), we maintain a consistent response structure for trend analysis, ensuring that the UI can display results consistently without needing source-specific handling.

4. **Error Resilience Strategy**: We've implemented multiple fallback mechanisms and error handling throughout the trend analysis flow, ensuring that the feature degrades gracefully when faced with issues like parsing errors, timeout issues, or API unavailability.

5. **Structured JSON Output from LLM**: For the LLM-based analysis, we've carefully engineered prompts to encourage structured JSON output, complemented by robust parsing logic to handle potential variations in LLM responses.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented fallback mechanisms for database access and AI services

## Next Steps

- Implement additional safeguards for handling potentially invalid data
- Add further fallback mechanisms for other AI-dependent services
- Document new patterns in system architecture

## Active Decisions
- Using admin client with service role token only for specific operations requiring RLS bypass
- Implementing progressive enhancement for data access: try with regular client first, fallback to admin client
- Maintaining dual authentication system while ensuring user source tracking
