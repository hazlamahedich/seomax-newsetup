# Active Context: SEOMax Development

## Current Focus
We are implementing and optimizing the content analysis features of SEOMax. Our recent work has focused on:

1. Implementing content analysis components:
   - ContentOptimizer for applying SEO suggestions
   - ContentPerformance for tracking content metrics
   - ContentGapAnalysis for competitor comparison

2. Enhancing existing components:
   - ContentBrief with collaboration features
   - TopicClusterMap with improved visualization

3. Developing backend services:
   - ContentAnalyzer with methods for various analysis types
   - Services for managing content, suggestions, performance, and gap analysis

4. Fixing critical application issues:
   - React hydration errors caused by browser extensions
   - Session fetch errors with "Unexpected end of JSON input"
   - Supabase client export problems
   - Middleware improvements for session handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using vanilla LangChain instead of @langchain packages due to availability
- Implementing custom text splitting functionality to replace missing modules
- Using type declaration files to handle missing module types
- Focusing on keyword research as the primary AI-powered feature
- Ensuring proper error handling for AI service calls
- Designing a consistent UI across project features
- Creating reusable AI service classes for different analysis types
- Implementing proper data visualization for analysis results
- Building a flexible project structure that can accommodate future features
- Using suppressHydrationWarning to handle DOM modifications by browser extensions like Grammarly
- Implementing fallback session object to prevent "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors
- Adding timeouts to fetch operations to prevent hanging requests
- Using a consistent theme provider setup to avoid hydration mismatches
- Providing fallback URLs for Supabase in case environment variables are missing
