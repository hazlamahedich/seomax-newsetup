# Active Context: SEOMax Development

## Current Focus
We are implementing and optimizing the content analysis features of SEOMax. Our recent work has focused on:

1. Implementing content analysis components:
   - ContentOptimizer for applying SEO suggestions
   - ContentPerformance for tracking content metrics
   - ContentGapAnalysis for competitor comparison

2. Enhancing existing components:
   - ContentBrief with collaboration features
   - TopicClusterMap with improved visualization

3. Developing backend services:
   - ContentAnalyzer with methods for various analysis types
   - Services for managing content, suggestions, performance, and gap analysis

4. Fixing critical application issues:
   - React hydration errors caused by browser extensions
   - Session fetch errors with "Unexpected end of JSON input"
   - Supabase client export problems
   - Middleware improvements for session handling

5. Enhancing the testing infrastructure for SEOMax, with a specific emphasis on end-to-end (E2E) testing using Playwright. All the required E2E tests from phase 4 of the testing strategy have been successfully implemented.

We're currently focused on integrating the MCP Supabase server with our feedback system and creating an admin dashboard for feedback management. The system is designed to handle high traffic through a session pooler for better performance.

- Resolved session fetch errors by implementing a fallback session object
- Fixed Supabase client export issues for proper service integration
- Enhanced error handling for fetch operations with timeouts
- Optimized middleware for better session management

### E2E Test Implementation
- Created comprehensive E2E tests for user onboarding, keyword research, content optimization, technical SEO audits, and report generation.
- Added support files including test fixtures, helpers, and a setup script for test data.
- Implemented a full test environment setup process.
- Added new npm scripts for running E2E tests in various modes.

1. Added a user feedback system with a dialog component accessible from all pages
2. Implemented toast notifications for user feedback
3. Created the database schema for the feedback system
4. Integrated the feedback system with the main application layout
5. Added the Supabase session pooler for better database performance
6. Created an admin dashboard for feedback management and statistics

## Next Steps
1. Enhance the admin dashboard with filtering and search capabilities
2. Implement user role management to control access to admin features
3. Add data visualization components to better represent feedback trends
4. Create a notification system for new feedback
5. Implement an export feature for feedback data

7. **Test Environment Validation**:
   - Run the setup script to create test accounts: `npm run test:e2e:setup`
   - Start the development server and run tests to validate implementation.
   - Fix any remaining test stability issues.

8. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Ensure E2E tests are properly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Optimize test performance for CI execution.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Complete documentation of the testing approach and best practices.
   - Update test coverage reports.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using vanilla LangChain instead of @langchain packages due to availability
- Implementing custom text splitting functionality to replace missing modules
- Using type declaration files to handle missing module types
- Focusing on keyword research as the primary AI-powered feature
- Ensuring proper error handling for AI service calls
- Designing a consistent UI across project features
- Creating reusable AI service classes for different analysis types
- Implementing proper data visualization for analysis results
- Building a flexible project structure that can accommodate future features
- Using suppressHydrationWarning to handle DOM modifications by browser extensions like Grammarly
- Implementing fallback session object to prevent "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors
- Adding timeouts to fetch operations to prevent hanging requests
- Using a consistent theme provider setup to avoid hydration mismatches
- Providing fallback URLs for Supabase in case environment variables are missing

### MCP Server Integration
- Using a session pooler URL from Supabase to handle increased database traffic
- Implemented a fallback mechanism to use the regular client if the pooled client fails
- Created a dedicated admin interface for managing feedback

### Feedback System
- Designed a comprehensive feedback model with different types (bug reports, feature requests, etc.)
- Implemented a status system to track the lifecycle of feedback (new, in review, planned, etc.)
- Created statistics aggregation for administrative overview
- Using optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### Admin Dashboard
- Restricted access to admin features based on email domain
- Created statistical visualizations for feedback metrics
- Implemented batch operations for feedback management
- Used the pooled client for all admin operations to handle potential high loads

### Performance Considerations
- Using the session pooler for database-intensive operations
- Implemented proper error handling throughout the application
- Optimized database queries with appropriate indexes
- Used client-side caching where appropriate to reduce database load

## Active Decisions
- **Testing Strategy**: Following the comprehensive testing strategy outlined in TESTING.md, with end-to-end tests serving as the final validation layer for critical user journeys.
- **Test Data Management**: Using a combination of fixtures and runtime setup for test data to ensure tests are reliable and isolated.
- **Authentication Approach**: Implementing an authentication helper to streamline login flows across tests.
