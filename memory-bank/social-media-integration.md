# Social Media Integration in SEOMax

## Overview
The social media integration module in SEOMax provides comprehensive analysis of a website's social media presence and its integration with the main website. The implementation fulfills all requirements of creating a module that checks for social media profile links, verifies profiles, collects statistics, and evaluates social sharing features.

## Core Components

### SocialMediaAnalysisService

     postFrequency: number; // Average posts per week
     lastUpdated: string;
     verified: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. **SocialMediaMetrics**
   ```typescript
   interface SocialMediaMetrics {
     totalFollowers: number;
     totalEngagement: number;
     platformCoverage: number; // Percentage of recommended platforms used
     averagePostFrequency: number;
     profileConsistency: number; // Percentage of profile elements consistent across platforms
     siteIntegration: number; // Scale of 0-100 representing social media integration on the website
   }
   ```

3. **SocialMediaIntegration**
   ```typescript
   interface SocialMediaIntegration {
     hasSocialLinks: boolean;
     hasSocialSharing: boolean;
     hasOpenGraph: boolean;
     hasTwitterCards: boolean;
     hasRichPins: boolean;
     socialIconsPosition: 'header' | 'footer' | 'sidebar' | 'multiple' | 'none';
   }
   ```

4. **SocialMediaAnalysis**
   ```typescript
   interface SocialMediaAnalysis {
     siteId: string;
     url: string;
     profiles: SocialMediaProfile[];
     metrics: SocialMediaMetrics;
     integration: SocialMediaIntegration;
     contentAlignment: number; // Scale of 0-100
     score: number;
     grade: {
       letter: string;
       color: string;
       label: string;
     };
     recommendations: string[];
     summary: string;
     createdAt: string;
   }
   ```

5. **SocialMediaIssue**
   ```typescript
   interface SocialMediaIssue {
     id: string;
     type: string;
     severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'info';
     description: string;
     recommendation: string;
     impact: string;
   }
   ```
