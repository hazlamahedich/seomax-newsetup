## CI/CD Integration

The end-to-end tests have been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/test.yml`. The tests run automatically on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.

## Current Status and Next Steps

**Current Status**: All tests have been implemented but are currently failing as expected because:
1. The application server needs to be running
2. Test user accounts need to be created in the development database
3. Mock data needs to be seeded for testing

**Next Steps**:
1. Run the setup script to create test accounts: `npm run test:e2e:setup`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Run the tests: `npm run test:e2e`

## Conclusion

All items from phase 4 of the testing strategy have been successfully implemented. The tests provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality and will help ensure the application's quality and reliability. The next phase is to configure the test environment and run the tests to verify the implementation.
