## Troubleshooting

### Hydration Errors
React hydration errors can occur when the server-rendered HTML doesn't match what the client tries to render. Common causes include:

- Browser extensions modifying the DOM (like Grammarly)
- Server/client conditional code that renders differently
- Date/time formatting differences
- Random values that change on each render

#### Resolution:
1. We've added `suppressHydrationWarning` to both the `html` and `body` elements in `RootLayout` to prevent errors from browser extensions.
2. Default themes are set with a consistent "system" theme to avoid dark/light mode mismatches.

### Session Fetch Errors
"Unexpected end of JSON input" errors can occur when fetching session data, especially during initial load.

#### Resolution:
1. We've configured SessionProvider with a fallback session object:
   ```typescript
   <SessionProvider 
     refetchInterval={0}
     refetchOnWindowFocus={false}
     session={{
       expires: new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 86400).toISOString(),
       user: { id: "", name: null, email: null, image: null }
     }}
   >
   ```

2. Added timeout handling for fetch operations in Supabase client.

### Supabase Connection Issues

#### Resolution:
1. Updated the Supabase client to provide better error handling and fallbacks when environment variables are missing.
2. Added proper export of `createClient` to ensure compatibility across the application.
3. Implemented timeout handling for fetch operations to prevent hanging requests.
