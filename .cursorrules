## PDF Generation Patterns
- PDFGenerationService implements static methods for modular PDF creation
- PDF generation workflow: create document → add metadata → add branding → generate content → manage pagination → output as data URI
- PDF reports follow consistent structure: header, summary, metrics, category scores, recommendations, technical issues, conclusion
- Color coding implemented for scores (green/blue/amber/red) and severity levels
- PDF button component handles generation state (idle, loading, success, error) with visual feedback
- PDF downloads use proper browser security policies with data URIs and temporary link elements
- Error handling includes graceful fallbacks and user notifications via toast
- Local SEO analysis integrated into PDF reports with specialized sections

## Technical SEO Component Patterns
- Uses a tabbed interface with categories: Overview, Issues, Checks, Trends
- Issues are categorized by severity (critical, high, medium, low, info) with corresponding colors
- Each technical element (robots.txt, sitemap, etc.) has its own card with status indicator
- Progress components show score percentages with color-coded indicators
- Charts use consistent color schemes for historical trends
- Static data structure for technical checks with standardized properties

## Local SEO Component Patterns

- NAP consistency display with formatting to highlight differences
- Google Business Profile detection with status indicators
- Schema markup validation with code highlighting for LocalBusiness schema
- Map embed detection with visual indicators for implementation status
- Local keyword context analysis with usage highlighting
- Component-specific scores with weighted calculation for overall score
- Formatted business information display with validation status indicators
- Recommendation cards with priority levels and implementation guidance

## Content Rewriter Component Patterns
- Tab-based interface with sections for input, results, and history
- Form component with validation for content and keywords
- E-E-A-T signal preservation toggle with explanatory tooltips
- Progress indicators during processing
- Results display with metrics for readability and keyword usage
- Color-coded indicators for score quality (green/amber/red)

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If encountering hydration errors, check DOM modifications from browser extensions
- For session issues, ensure SessionProvider has fallback options
- Network timeouts may require adjusting fetch timeout settings
- For tests are failing, check Jest DOM matchers and mock service setup
- Check for missing environment variables when Supabase connections fail
- For E2E test failures, ensure test users exist and dev server is running
- If PDF generation fails, check browser console for jsPDF or HTML2Canvas errors
- For PDF styling issues, inspect the scale and dimensions set in the PDFGenerationService
- Technical SEO service issues are usually related to CORS or network timeouts
- Local SEO analysis may fail on sites with inconsistent NAP formatting
  - Check normalization functions in LocalSEOService
- Schema validation issues often relate to missing or malformed LocalBusiness properties
  - Inspect schema extraction logic in SchemaMarkupService integration
- LLM errors may occur with malformed prompts or exceeded token limits
