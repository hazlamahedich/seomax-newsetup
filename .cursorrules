# SEOMax Project Intelligence

## Project Structure
- Next.js 15+ project using the App Router
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- LangChain for AI services
- Supabase for database and authentication
- React ecosystem (React Query, Zustand, Framer Motion)

## Critical Implementation Paths
- AI-powered analysis uses ContentAnalyzer and KeywordAnalyzer services
- React's strict mode can cause double rendering, be cautious with stateful operations
- User auth flows through next-auth with Supabase credentials provider
- Content analysis runs in stages: readability → keyword usage → structure → suggestions

## User Preferences
- Clear, actionable suggestions for content optimization
- Visual representation of SEO metrics with trends over time
- Simplified UI for complex analysis tasks
- Quick access to most important metrics from dashboard

## Project-Specific Patterns
- Component files follow naming pattern: [Functionality][ComponentType].tsx
- Services use class-based approach with instance methods
- AI services separate prompts from implementation logic
- State management combines React Query for server state and Zustand for UI state
- Testing uses React Testing Library with Jest

## Known Challenges
- Hydration errors can occur with browser extensions like Grammarly
  - Solution: Use suppressHydrationWarning attribute on body and html
- Session fetch errors with "Unexpected end of JSON input"
  - Solution: Provide fallback session object in SessionProvider
- Supabase client export issues
  - Solution: Export createClient directly from client.ts
- LangChain compatibility with TypeScript requires custom type declarations
- Mock services simulate API calls until actual integrations are built

## Evolution of Decisions
- Moved from route handlers to server components for data fetching
- Enhanced error handling with more detailed user feedback
- Added comprehensive type safety for all API responses
- Improved state management with better typing and error boundaries
- Added middleware for handling auth edge cases

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If encountering hydration errors, check DOM modifications from browser extensions
- For session issues, ensure SessionProvider has fallback options
- Network timeouts may require adjusting fetch timeout settings
- If tests are failing, check Jest DOM matchers and mock service setup
- Check for missing environment variables when Supabase connections fail

## Code Conventions
- Use named exports for components and functions
- Include prop interfaces for all components
- Follow the naming pattern: interface [ComponentName]Props
- Place shared utilities in the /lib directory
- Handle loading and error states for all data-dependent components
