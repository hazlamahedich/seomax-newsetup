# SEO Max Testing Strategy

This document outlines our comprehensive testing approach for the SEO Max application to ensure quality, reliability, and performance while working within Vercel and Supabase free tier constraints.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)

- **Purpose**: Test individual functions, hooks, and components in isolation.
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for core utilities and components.
- **Command**: `npm test`

#### Component Testing:
- Test UI components for correct rendering, state changes, and user interactions.
- Ensure accessibility compliance.
- Test component variations (different props, states).

#### Hook Testing:
- Validate custom hook logic and state management.
- Test hook error boundaries and edge cases.

#### Utility Testing:
- Test helper functions, data transformations, and business logic.
- Validate algorithm correctness.

### 2. Integration Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)

- **Purpose**: Test how components and services work together.
- **Coverage**: Critical user flows and component interactions.
- **Command**: `npm test`

#### Key Integration Tests:
- Authentication flows (login, signup, password reset)
- Project creation and management
- SEO analysis pipeline
- Data fetching and state management

### 3. API Testing (Jest + MSW)

- **Purpose**: Test API routes and Supabase interactions.
- **Coverage**: All API endpoints with various status codes and responses.
- **Approach**: Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept and mock API requests.

#### Key API Tests:
- Authentication endpoints
- Data CRUD operations
- Error handling and rate limiting
- Response validation and schema checking

### 4. End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

- **Purpose**: Test complete user journeys in a real browser environment.
- **Coverage**: Critical user paths and workflows.
- **Command**: `npm run test:e2e`

#### Key E2E Tests:
- User onboarding flow
- Keyword research and analysis
- Content optimization workflow
- Technical SEO audit process
- Report generation

### 5. Performance Testing (Lighthouse CI)

- **Purpose**: Monitor and optimize application performance.
- **Coverage**: Core pages and critical user paths.
- **Metrics**:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - Time to Interactive (TTI)
  - Total Blocking Time (TBT)
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### 6. Database Testing

- **Purpose**: Test database queries, schemas, and operations.
- **Approach**: Use test database and mocked Supabase client.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Query optimization for free tier constraints
  - Data integrity validation
  - Migration testing

## Free Tier Optimization for Testing

### Vercel Free Tier Considerations

1. **Minimize Build Time**:
   - Use efficient test runners and parallelization.
   - Skip unnecessary tests in CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Reduce Deployment Volume**:
   - Implement proper git workflows to avoid excessive deployments.
   - Use feature flags for testing new features.

3. **Optimize Serverless Functions**:
   - Mock external API calls during testing.
   - Test function performance and resource usage.

### Supabase Free Tier Considerations

1. **Database Usage Optimization**:
   - Use test database with minimal data for testing.
   - Clean up test data after test runs.

2. **Bandwidth Conservation**:
   - Mock Supabase responses when appropriate.
   - Use efficient queries to minimize data transfer.

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Test and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Unit and Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: E2E Tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Local Development

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create `.env.test` for test-specific configurations.
   - Use mocked services for external dependencies.

2. **Test Database**:
   - Set up local Supabase instance for development.
   - Use test data fixtures for consistent testing.

### CI Environment

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Store test credentials securely in GitHub secrets.
   - Use environment-specific configuration.

2. **Test Isolation**:
   - Ensure each test run uses isolated resources.
   - Reset state between test runs.

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**:
   - Group tests by feature/module.
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
   - Use descriptive test names that explain behavior.

2. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Mock external services and APIs.
   - Use consistent mock implementations.
   - Document mock behavior in test files.

3. **Test Data Management**:
   - Use factories or fixtures for test data.
   - Avoid hardcoded test values.
   - Clean up test data after tests complete.

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Review test coverage regularly.
   - Refactor tests as application evolves.
   - Add tests for bugs before fixing them.

## Monitoring & Metrics

1. **Coverage Reporting**:
   - Track code coverage with Jest and Codecov.
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds.

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use Lighthouse CI for performance regression testing.
   - Monitor Vercel and Supabase resource usage.

3. **Error Tracking**:
   - Implement proper error logging in tests.
   - Review test failures and flaky tests regularly.
